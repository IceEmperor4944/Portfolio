            My name is Nathan Sears. I am from Southwest Colorado, right along the Four Corners region. I enjoy making music of all kinds, 
            and have been for years. I also like being out in the wilderness, and try to go out as often as I can. I also enjoy playing games
            of all kinds, including things such as Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, and various board games.
