            My name is Nathan Sears. I am from Southwest Colorado, right along the Four Corners region. I enjoy making music of <em>all</em> kinds, 
            and have been for years. I also like being out in the wilderness, and try to go out as often as I can. I also enjoy playing games
            of all kinds, including things such as Dungeons & Dragons, Magic: The Gathering, and various board games.
        </p>

            I have been working towards the computer science field for as long as I can remember. I have always wanted to do something with 
            computers, and this led me to <strong>Neumont</strong>. At this school, I have further improved the skills I previously had, and shall
            continue to do so throughout this school career.
