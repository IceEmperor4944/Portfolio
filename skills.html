            I have been working with programming for many years now. I first started learning text-based coding at 12 years old, and since then have
            developed a wide range of skills in the programming world. I have understanding of the programming languages Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, Ruby,
            C++, and HTML. I also have multiple years of experience with these languages, and as such can use them thoroughly for work. I am able to create
            systems ranging from web pages to complex programs easily.
